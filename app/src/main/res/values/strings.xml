    <string name="rulesText">Pig-Dice-Game: Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to \"hold\": If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player\'s turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player\'s turn continues. If a player chooses to \"hold\", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player\'s turn. The first player to score 100 or more points wins. Two-Dice Pig: This variation is the same as Pig, except:
    Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.
    If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
    If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
    If a double is rolled, the point total is added together and doubled before being added to the players score </string>
